            </div>
            <p >Let's get some basic info out of the way. My name is Andrei Dadu<br>
            I'm 15 years old. I was born and raised in Moldova until around 2013 when my family moved to Denmark,
            i came back to Moldova around 2018. I enjoy most STEM subjects like math, programming, physics, chemistry etc. 
            And struggle with others like languages. My hobbies include reading, swimming, robotics, cooking, music and drawing.
            Two of the biggest joys of my life are my friends and my family, 
            they've supported me through everything and i cant thank them enough for it.
